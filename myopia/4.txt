Hi linurm,

(Missed yesterday's e-mail, "Fix Your Eyes?  First, Measure Your Myopia"?  Find it here.)

Yesterday I gave you some homework, so right now you probably have a bunch of numbers you have no idea what to do with. First, let me just tell you that these numbers are vital. They tell us almost everything we need to know about eye strain, where you need to apply habit changes, and what kind of lens correction your eyes actually need in order to feel better. Powerful knowledge is hiding in those numbers.

Here's a quick primer on how to interpret them:

First, you've got morning vs. midday vs. late day/evening. This shows you a range of distances. I want you to think back to the second e-mail, because it is important here that you understand your eyesight is not static. I wish there was a double bold function. Re-read that! Eyesight—not static. Your eyes change in terms of “degrees” of myopia throughout a single day.

What's going on here?

Well, I won't flog the optometrist's dead horse too much, but that single measurement obtained in the darkened room was wrong. The easiest "fix" for your myopia is just to give you as much correction as you can possibly tolerate. It's not a great idea, but then neither is a drive-through burger joint.

But now back to those numbers. The way they change gives you clues as to where the strain that contributes to your worsening eyesight is coming from. Let's use an example to illustrate this, and let's use…me.

I too used to be quite myopic. I have my old measurement logs (by the way, do keep logs; they contain powerful information you’ll want long term). Here is one of my mornings from 2005:

L: 32 cm; R: 36 cm

If you use the calculator (you're welcome), you’ll get the following diopter results: -3 and -2.75. Can you guess what my actual prescription was back then (yes, do keep a log!)? It was -2.75 for both eyes.

Almost perfect, but it was about time to reduce it by 0.25. Now you may remember that I told you I used to wear -4.00 glasses, so by this point I was already well on my way to a lower prescription. And my progress at this point was actually greater than it may seem. That -4.00 prescription when I first began my journey? It was 0.75 diopters too low.

Why am I telling you all this? Well, the first important thing to understand here is that your prescription is relative. You need to understand your eyes and what prescription they actually need. But for now, let’s get back to my results.

My morning measurements were L: 32 cm and R: 36 cm.

By midday, my measurements were L: 30 cm and R: 35 cm.

The numbers went down. What does that mean? It means I could see less well by the middle of the day than I could in the morning. That's strange, right? And you might be experiencing something similar too; it's the most common type of centimeter curve (yes, these descriptions are basically my own inventions since the mainstream just sells you more glasses).

In the evening my measurements were L: 28 cm and R: 32 cm.

Ouch! 28 cm equals a -3.50 prescription. I just went up a half diopter, from -3.00 to -3.50, in the course of a single day. That's not good! But can you guess what the measurement was the following morning? It was back to 32 cm. What is going on here?

It’s eye strain. Remember the ciliary (focusing) muscle? It's not happy by the end of the day. It's getting "stuck" in close-up mode, and that's really affecting my eyesight. But at night, when you go to sleep, the ciliary muscle relaxes, and then the morning is like a reset, with everything working as it should.

Here's what should really be opening your proverbial eyes. There's a lot going on here, and with just some Jake knowledge to help you out, you can measure your diopters objectively. You can quite literally quantify your eye strain with cold, hard, numbers. Its powerful stuff.

So now that you know this, what should you do?

Keep measuring. Create a reminder to measure a few times a day for the next week. You want to look for trends, such as how your eyesight is on off days with no close-up work, on days with exercise, on days spent in natural daylight, etc. You want to compare your vision in good lighting vs. crappy fluorescent lighting. Just get some numbers! You’ll want them in the future.
Read. The more you learn, the better off you’ll be. Take a look at this page on successful natural myopia control and take in as much as you can!
--> Tomorrow we'll talk about the dark specter of axial elongation, which is basically the one thing you really want to avoid. It's the number one piece of the progressive myopia puzzle, and the thing that ends up causing all sorts of retinal problems down the road. I’ll also let you in on the single worst thing you could be doing for your eyes—the one thing you really don’t want to do at all, ever. It really is must-read territory.

See you tomorrow!

Cheers,
