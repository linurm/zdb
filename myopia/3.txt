Ready to learn about measuring your eyesight? It's heady stuff. After this e-mail, you'll never look at your local optic shop the same again.

Here’s the thing: If you can measure, you can quantify; if you can measure, you can start to know what's what; if you can measure, you can know what you really need, and what's probably way too much correction.

There's a brilliant and super simple way to measure your own eyesight, too, and it’s with a ten cent ruler. I'll show you how to do it right here.

(If you want to get a bit more serious about your measurements, you can print out an eye chart and order a test lens kit online for a hundred bucks. But even without those, you can figure out your exact diopters with just that ten cent ruler.)

WARNING: Don't go buying reduced diopter glasses without fully understanding what you're doing. I'm not giving you prescription advice. I'm not offering medical advice. I'm simply teaching you about biology and optics.

Now back to that ruler and how to measure.

A flexible measuring tape is actually best—you know, the kind that rolls up (usually sold cheaply at fabric stores or on Amazon).  You’ll need a ruler or tape measure to be able to measure the distance from your eye to a page (or screen).

Here's how you take the measurement:

Take off your glasses.
Look at your screen or a book (printed pages are best).
Start with your face up quite close, where the text is perfectly clear, and then slowly move back until it is just the tiniest bit blurry. You want to stop at the point where the text stops being totally sharp. Any noticeable change in sharpness and that's your distance.
Record the distance between your eyes and the page (or screen) in centimeters.
Now get ready for the thing that blew my mind when I first learned about it.

A diopter (the number that defines the strength of your glasses) is just a unit of measurement of inverse meters. Get it? A diopter converts directly to a specific distance (as in the centimeters you recorded from your point of clear sight distance to blurriness). It really is shockingly simple, like a lot of the things you'll learn from me. However far you can see before the “blur” converts directly to how many diopters you need for "perfect" distance vision.

Are you still not completely with me? Let's use an example:

Let's say your glasses are -4.50. This number was obtained at the optometrist’s with you sitting in the chair under the dimmed lights with and all the fancy gear and the smoke and mirrors. There, it seemed impossible for you to figure out this number on your own. But now you realize that -4.50 diopters is just another way of saying "22 centimeters till blurriness."

This means that if the text you see on the page becomes even the tiniest bit blurry at 22 centimeters, then you need -4.50 diopters to see the eye chart clearly past the 20/20 line.

That's it. Nothing complicated about it. Take that in for a moment.

To help you convert your centimeters into diopters, I’ve created a handy calculator. Before I give you the link to it though, a word of warning: Your results will possibly be surprising. Your measurements might result in a diopter correction different than the one you received at the optometrist’s.

Here is how you convert your centimeter result to diopters, using my calculator.

This will work for you if you have the most common type of myopia (strain and stimulus). If you have a more complex diagnosis from an ophthalmologist—any kind of actual eye disease—then that's a different topic and should be monitored by a doctor.

You may be wondering how the ruler can work the way an optometrist’s tools do and yet still give you a different result. Simply put, the optometrist most likely gave you more diopters than you actually need most of the time. They tested you in a dark room and gave you the absolute maximum diopter correction. They didn’t account for how your eyesight may vary throughout the day. It also depends how long ago you received your previous glasses and how your eyes have changed.

This will all make sense once you try measuring and you read through the next few e-mails.

This is one of the first real steps. Take it and you'll feel compelled to go on to get your eyesight back. And just to make sure you do, I’m going to leave you with a bit of homework:

Measure your left and right eye. Do it in the morning, before you start work, and in front of a screen. Do it again at midday and once again in the evening.

Be sure to write down your results. You'll need them tomorrow (when I show you how those numbers tell the future of your eyesight).

Here's an example of how your results should look:

Morning: Left: 22 cm; Right: 26 cm

Midday: Left: 21 cm; Right: 25 cm

Evening: Left: 19 cm; Right: 22 cm

Remember that these are just examples, and how much the numbers change says a lot about how you are using your eyes and where the problems might lie.

We'll get to that tomorrow!

P.S.:  We have a very active support group for endmyopia on Facebook.  Hundreds of members discussing eyesight, improving their vision, and lots of tricks and tiops there.  :)

It's a closed group, but I'll send you a link once you complete this e-mail series. (and I promise I'll accept your membership request then, when you're ready for it!)
